# Current Status: Agent Configuration

## Current Implementation: Unified Agent (Simplified)

For stability and to ensure streaming works properly, we're currently using a **unified agent** that handles both capabilities in a single agent.

### What Works Now

✅ **Single Agent with Dual Capabilities**
- Transaction analysis and calendar optimization
- Financial education and Q&A
- Proper streaming with thoughts enabled
- Works with existing frontend infrastructure

### Agent Configuration

```python
# app/agent.py
root_agent = LlmAgent(
    name=config.internal_agent_name,
    model=config.model,
    description="Alto's financial assistant - transaction analysis & education",
    planner=BuiltInPlanner(
        thinking_config=genai_types.ThinkingConfig(include_thoughts=True)
    ),
    # ... instruction with both capabilities ...
)
```

### Why Simplified?

The multi-agent delegation pattern from ADK requires:
1. Proper ADK version with full delegation support
2. Backend to correctly stream delegated responses
3. Frontend to handle multi-agent streaming events

The unified agent approach:
- ✅ Works immediately with existing infrastructure
- ✅ Streams thoughts and responses correctly
- ✅ Handles both use cases effectively
- ✅ Single conversation context
- ✅ Simpler debugging

## Future: Multi-Agent System (Ready to Enable)

The full multi-agent system is implemented and ready in `/app/agents/`:
- `coordinator_agent.py` - Routes requests
- `calendar_agent.py` - Transaction specialist
- `qa_agent.py` - Education specialist

### To Enable Multi-Agent System:

1. **Verify ADK supports LLM-driven delegation** in your version
2. **Test agent transfer mechanism** works with streaming
3. **Update agent.py** to use the multi-agent setup:

```python
from app.agents import create_calendar_agent, create_coordinator_agent, create_qa_agent

calendar_agent = create_calendar_agent()
qa_agent = create_qa_agent()
root_agent = create_coordinator_agent()
root_agent.sub_agents = [calendar_agent, qa_agent]
```

4. **Verify streaming** handles multi-agent responses correctly

### Documentation

- **[MULTI_AGENT_GUIDE.md](./MULTI_AGENT_GUIDE.md)** - Full multi-agent architecture
- **[example_queries.md](./example_queries.md)** - Test queries for both modes

## Testing

### Start Backend
```bash
cd /Users/christianevans/Documents/PersonalProgramming/NextProjects/alto-starter
make dev-backend
```

### Test Queries

**Transaction Analysis:**
```
"I have a $1200 rent payment on the 15th. When should I schedule it based on my cashflow?"
```

**Financial Education:**
```
"What is credit utilization and how does it affect my credit score?"
```

Both queries work with the current unified agent.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test unified agent responds correctly
2. ✅ Verify streaming works without errors
3. ⏳ Enable multi-agent system after confirming basic functionality
4. ⏳ Test agent transfer mechanism
5. ⏳ Monitor delegated streaming responses

## Troubleshooting

### "No thoughts to process" Warning
This is just informational - it means that specific SSE chunk didn't contain thoughts. 
As long as you see responses, the agent is working.

### No Response at All
1. Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/health`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Check backend logs for agent initialization message
4. Verify `.env` file has correct configuration

### Backend Not Starting
- Use `uv run` commands (not system python)
- Check `.env` file exists with proper values
- Verify Google Cloud credentials if using Vertex AI
